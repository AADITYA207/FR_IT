# LockedMe.com Prototype Development Documentation

## Project Overview

**Project Objective:**  
As a Full Stack Developer, the primary objective is to complete the features of the LockedMe.com application prototype through planned development sprints. The prototype will facilitate user interaction via a command line interface, and the source code will be managed and stored using GitHub. This prototype aims to secure budget approval by demonstrating the application's potential to relevant stakeholders.

## Background

**Company:**  
Lockers Pvt. Ltd. seeks to digitize its product offerings, starting with the development of the LockedMe.com application. As part of the initial phase, the prototype is essential for obtaining stakeholder buy-in and budget approval.

**Manager's Expectations:**  
The manager has outlined a set of deliverables to be presented within 15 working days, including:
1. Specification document detailing product capabilities, appearance, and user interactions.
2. Sprint planning with estimated number and duration.
3. Git and GitHub setup for version control and tracking.
4. Utilization of Java concepts and data structures.
5. Implementation of key operations:
   - Retrieve file names in ascending order.
   - Add, delete, and search files as specified by the user.
   - Navigation and application closure options.

**Goal:**  
Deliver a high-quality prototype promptly to secure stakeholder approval and funding.

## Application Flow and Features

### Sprint Planning

The development will be structured into two or more sprints, each with specific tasks and objectives to ensure a manageable and systematic approach.

**Algorithms:**
1. **File Retrieval:**  
   Use of Java's `File` class to list and sort directory contents.
2. **File Addition:**  
   Implementing a method to add files, ensuring case-insensitivity.
3. **File Deletion:**  
   Case-sensitive deletion to ensure accuracy.  
   Handling "File not found" scenarios gracefully.
4. **File Search:**  
   Case-sensitive search for precise file retrieval.
